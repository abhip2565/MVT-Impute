## Introduction

Welcome to the Data Analysis Notebook dedicated to enhancing your data handling and prediction capabilities. This notebook is your guide to mastering advanced techniques for addressing missing values and leveraging the power of regression to predict future trends.

### Bridging the Gap: Interpolation for Missing Values

Handling missing values is a critical aspect of data analysis. In this notebook, we'll explore an efficient technique known as interpolation. Interpolation allows us to estimate missing values within a dataset, providing a complete and accurate representation for analysis.

### Unleashing Predictive Insights: Regression for Future Trends

Predicting future trends is a powerful tool for decision-making. Regression analysis enables us to model relationships between variables and make informed predictions. We'll delve into regression techniques that offer valuable insights into the trajectory of your data.

### What to Expect

1. **Understanding Missing Data**: Gain insights into the types and impact of missing data in your datasets.

2. **Interpolation Techniques**: Learn various interpolation methods.

3. **Regression Models**: Explore regression models such as linear regression and auto regression for future forecasting.

4. **Practical Application**: Apply these techniques to real-world datasets, ensuring you're well-equipped for data analysis challenges.

By the end of this notebook, you'll have the tools to prevent missing values and harness the predictive potential of regression. Let's dive in and empower your data analysis journey!
